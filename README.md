## ...?
Personal logs for and an exercise to accurately explain emotions in words. The drawback of accuracy here is reachability; I know from the past my friends were confused in scenarios such as:
1. I get asked "how are you" or things alike
2. I respond with, for example: "subtle yet strong sense of calm >> peace |>> lingering neutrality"
3. Friend replies with: "what", "huh", "tf does that mean", \*unfriends\* coz they think I'm deranged (somehow) AND/OR too cryptic (fair enough)

There are a few problems with this: I knew what I was thinking of precisely while writing said message, there's some logic to it, but no one else really understood.
Like with undocumented code, if I read such a message say 8 months later, I wouldn't be able to decipher it myself, as there's no standard language I used.

I don't have any examples on hand, unfortunately, as a lot of that is old.

I will add more explanations when I have time, for now this repo only contains a copy of what was on my profile's README.  
That clogged more space on my profile than I wanted, so moved it here.

The directory `xidefs/stream.md` contains said copy, which explains the basics. I cut one part from it, that's the part on top here.
