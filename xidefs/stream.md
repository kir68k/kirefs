### A brief introduction
This section might seem odd, or cryptic to most (I presume anyway), due to language mixing, words and symbols I make up and give meaning to myself :P
I like logs and putting everything into words, this includes my emotional state and anything relating to it, that's what this is for.

This is a "log" of sorts for my _emotional substate_ on a given day/week (whenever the next update is), a general _long-term state_, and my current _emotional subpersonality_.
Some of this is defined below for clarity and for me to remember consistently.

Initially started doing this on other sites or my notes to help express how I feel in words, even if cryptic, which in retrospect was chaotic without a single clear definition.
The initial goal is still here and is the primary goal, but now I like this as a challenge (emotions are hard), and self-expression is fun.

Subject to change.
- Emotions
  - **Mental State** (MS): Me, mentally, as a whole. Made up of everything else under it.
  - **Long-term State** (LTS): A set of general thoughts/emotions with infrequent change, _generally_ compatible with any subpersonality.
  - **Subpersonality** (SP)
    - What gives my appearance/aesthetic at a given time.
    - My currently primary "personality" (set of emotions/mindset >> appearance).
    - Generally synced with LTS, but can divert.
- Terms
  - **Hyperassociation** (Verb): Maximal "association" with the physical "reality", hard to achieve sober.
    - Easiest way to describe would be extreme agility/swiftness mentally AND/OR physically, i.e. quick-thinking, ***extreme*** but healthy focus.
  - **Likora** (Noun): Signifies an update of anything inside the MS, primarily the currently active SP, followed by what was updated.
- Symbols
  - **⛥**: Interconnectivity, anti-realism, a separator, similar to `>>`.
  - **>>**: Think of it as "in turn", i.e. "emotions and in turn appearance" -> "emotions >> appearance", the word/subject before `>>` forms/goes into whatever comes after. Frequently used.
    - Like in the definition for **～** (tilde), **>>** can be "chained", e.g. `word1 >> word2 >> word 3`, where word1 forms word 2, which in turn forms word3.
  - **|>>**: Same as `>>`, but _everything_ before `|>>` forms whatever comes after, instead of only the last word or subject. Less frequently used.
  - **～**: Signifies clarity >> serenity >> tranquility |>> peace. (Good example for previous defs, imo :3)
  - **>><**: Same as `>>`, but bidirectional, think of it as the symbol for equillibrium.

#### "Subpersonality" and its components
The most integral part. A subpersonality is, as the name hopefully implies, a "division" or part of my general long-term personality & emotions at a given time, as illustrated earlier.

**Subpersonalities** are split into two parts:
- **The emotional substate**
  - A set of _primary_ emotions/mindset in a subpersonality.
  - Example: "Serenity", or "clarity". Both can in turn signify tranquility, and both are "neutral" to "positive" emotions.
- **The Associated Appearance**
  - My external appearance (how I look to others) associated with emotions from the emotional substate.
    - Hard to define this for SPs from my own perspective, naturally... >.>
    - As it's how others generally *perceive* this SP, it doesn't have to ***actually be true***.
      - For example, xeta's AA includes "apathetic", which isn't actually how I feel in that SP ***at all***, but my actions >> AA, especially "unconditional honesty" can make it look like I do. Even with all of this it's hard to explain.
  - Includes: Style of writing, humor, facial expressions, emotional responses (crying, laughing, ...), profile pictures.

#### Current SPs
There is always _one_ "predominant" or "active" subpersonality at a given time, true transcendence would require all of them active at once, maybe. The current subpersonalities are:
- xira
  - The primary SP unofficially until 2024-07-23, officially 2024-08-05.
  - Emotional substate: \[pacifism, calmness, optics, resolving, general anti-realism]
  - Associated Appearance: Relaxed, caring, positive, feminine.
- xeta
  - The primary SP unofficially as of 2024-07-23, officially 2024-08-05, until 2024-09-13.
  - Emotional substate: \[serenity, harsh empathy >> unconditional honesty ("tough love"), hyperassociation, respite, sharpness]
  - Associated Appearance: Robotic, apathetic, edgy, fast.
- lira
  - The primary SP officially as of 2024-09-13.
  - Emotional substate: \[serenity revised, precision, confidence, ⛥ moderate tranquility「遍在する」⛥ :3\]
  - Associated Appearance: Relaxed >>< fast >> gently chaotic, feminine.
  - Generally, this state is between xira and xeta.
- thea
  - Less common, but well perceived version of lira.
  - Closer to xira >> ⛥ higher tranquility ⛥, rather than in the middle of both main SPs.
